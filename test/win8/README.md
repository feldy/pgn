===================

Demo for my blog post tutorial "How to Create Windows-8-like Animations with CSS3 and jQuery" : http://blog.sarasoueidan.com/windows8-animations.

The source code does not contain vendor prefixes, it does have prefix-free linked, though.

The demo works in the latest versions of all browsers, including IE10.
